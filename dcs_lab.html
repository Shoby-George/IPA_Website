A control system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its control signal in a pre-defined way without responding to how the load reacts. In a feed-forward system, the control variable adjustment is not error-based. Instead it is based on knowledge about the process in the form of a mathematical model of the process and knowledge about or measurements of the process disturbances. Here also different control strategy like ON/OFF, P, PI, PD, PID are implemented and then results are analyzed.</p>

A Modbus RTU master device (the client) sends query messages to one or more slave devices (the servers) on a serial network. Queries may contain data, requests for data or status, or commands. Each slave on the network has a unique device address. Any query may be addressed to the broadcast address are called broadcast queries.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">The best way of using an additional controller to decrease upsets is to use the schemes called cascade control. The output of primary controller is used to adjust the set point of secondary controller, which in turn sends a signal to the final control element control valve. The process output is fed back to the controller, and a signal from intermediate stage of process is fed back to the secondary controller. The main advantage of cascade control is that performance is better for all types of load changes. For disturbances that enter near the beginning of the system, the secondary controller starts corrective action before process output shows any deviation. A general rule is that response of inner loop should be much faster than the response of outer loop.</p>
